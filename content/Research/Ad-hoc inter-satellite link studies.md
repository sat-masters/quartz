Will probably also include something from [[Beamforming Studies]]

[Ad-hoc satellite networks](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.zorac.aub.aau.dk/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9527597)Creating a network of satellites ad-hoc.
- Not quite the same as we are looking into, but there could maybe be something interesting here. 

[Collaborative Data Downloading by Using Inter-Satellite Links in LEO Satellite Networks](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.zorac.aub.aau.dk/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7805169)
- Using multiple satellites to easier downlink data from the satellites.


[Research on distributed beamforming synchronization technology in inter-satellite link system](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/epub/10.1177/00202940221089256) 
	- Using distributed beamforming to get better inter satellite links, using a Weak Bit Feedback Algorithm. 

[Multi-Layer Space Information Networks: Access Design and Softwarization](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.zorac.aub.aau.dk/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9627690)
- Seems like something pretty close to what we are looking into, but maybe with multiple satellites. This one is important to read
